        <h2>Sicherheit in Netzwerken</h2>
        <p>
        The technologies, that are widely used in computer networks, wer designed at a time where security was not reagarded as an important issue. Only a few research institudes and universities had access to the internet. Because of different technical characteristics of these technologies there are varying requirements for many fields. One of the many topics of information security is the security of it-systems and computer networks. This field of expertise, has established a special set of words for this requirements. The requirements itself are known as "Protection Goals". In the follwing paragraphs are the protection goals that are in connection with a public-key-infrastructure.

        <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
        <p>
        The Federal Agency for Security in Information Technology defines the "proof of the integrity of elecctronic data" as "proof, that the data is complete and unedited"
        </p>
        <p>
        A contract is a very good example for data integrity. Lets assume, Bob wants to sell Alice a car. As normal, they want to write a sale contract for the exchange of this car. This contract contains information on the condition of the car, how many kilomiters have been driven and which extra equipment has been installed. Because of the many points contained in this contract, it is two pages long. At the end of the second page, there is a field for Alice and Bob where both of them can sign the contract. Many of the important agreements, for example the expected milage at the time of the handover, are on the first page. Because of this, Alice has some concerns with this method. For example, if the actual mileage does not match the contract, Bob could just swap the first page with a new one. In court it would not be possible, to proof which version of the contract is the one Alice an Bob originally aggreed upon. To resolve this scenario Bob and Alice agree, that each of them signs each page (in the judiciary this is known as "Initialling"). With the signature on each side, the integrity of a version of the contract can be proven because Bob can not exchange a page without the signature of Alice.
        </p>
        <p>
        The problem of data integrity also exists in the digital world. Without any additional measures, it is not possible to verify ob data has been changed while it traveled from the sender to the receiver. This is true for e-mails and also for websites. So, without additional measures to ensure integrity, it is not possible to check if the content of an e-mail is the same, as the text the sender wrote. Also there is no way to prove, if the HTML-Code, that describes a website, has been changed on the way from the server to the webbrowser. This can have serious consequences, for example, when somone condcuts business over the internet. PKIs offer a way, to assure the integrity of data. To learn more about it, you can go to the section <a href="./zertifikate.html">Digital Signatures an Certificates</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Authenticity</h3>
        <p>
        The Federal Agency for Security in Information Technology defines the "proof of the authenticity of electronic data" as "proof on the originality of the data and the unique mapping to the writer, creator and/or sender".
        </p>
        <p>
        The need for authenticity comes up when handling letters that have been written on the computer. Lets assueme, Bob gets an envelope. The sender is the address of a hotel. In the inside Bob finds a letter which says the following: "Dear Bob, someone stole my wallet at a conference. Can you please mail me 300 euros to the senderaddress? I will give you the money back when we see each other next time. You'll safe my life with this, Alice." Because of the fact, that the entire letter has been written and printed, Bob can not easily assume, that this letter is actually from Alice. Also he knows, that Alic is in fact at a conference at the said address and does not want to ignore the letter. To be sure, he calls the hotel and asks for Alice. She ensures him, that everything is still in her posession and quite puzzled by the letter. Another visitor of the conference that knows, that Alice and Bob know each other must have written said letter.
        </p>
        <p>
        The same problem from the example exist for all data that has been sent on a computer network. Also, the said scenario has been taken from real life events: All the time people get scammed and loose money because the belive e-mails similar to the letter and send money to alleged friends in need. Without additional measures you can not assume just like that, that a website is indeed the one you think you are visiting. Criminals for example try, to create portals to online banking sites and get users to enter their credentials to have access to their bank accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Data integrity is a crucial requirement for verifyable authenticity. This is quite easy to understand: Lets assume again, that bob gets a letter. This time, Alice wrote and signed the letter herself. So Bob can be sure, that Alice really needs the 300 euros from him (we ignore the fact, that the signature could have been a forgery). Now the problem is at hand, that the letter says, he should send the money to the address on the envelope. Somebody that had access to the letter could have removed the original envelope and put it in a new one. Because of this, Bob should call Alice again and verify the address of the hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
        A testament makes the dependency between integrity and authenticity even more obvious. A testament basically has to be written and signed by yourself. Only the signature of a typewritten document is not enough. Shortly we will learn, that authenticity without integrity could also have dangorous consequences. 
        </p>
        <p>
        A PKI fullfills the requirements to ensure the authenticity of the sender electronic data. In the plugin it is shown, how the authenticity of the sender of a text or a file can be verified. 
        </p>
        <h3>Non repudiation</h3>
        <p>
        The Federal Agency for Security in Information Technology defines non repudiation as the "warranty, that the authorship, the transmission and the reception of data and information can not be disputed".
        </p>
        <p>
        Non repudiation is needed for the validity of trades. This is the reason, why it needs to be a result of authenticity and integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
        Lets take the example of a car trade: Bob and Alice wrote a sale contract, and signed each of the pages. Because of the signature on each side, its integrity is ensured. The signatures itself prove the authenticity of both parties. Because of this, neither Alice nor Bob can dispute, that they have read and accepted the contract. Bob now gives Alice the car and lets her sign a confirmation of delivery. So Alice can not deny, that Bob has given her the car. This is very important, if Alice would not fullfill her duty of payment. When Alice now pays Bob the money for the car, she asks Bob for a receipe. So Bob can not deny, that Alice has already payed the money.
        </p>
        <p>
        Since PKIs help to ensure integrity and authenticity they can also ensure non repudiation. Although there are special legal requirements for the different operational scenarios of PKIs. At <a href="./zertifikate.html">"Digital Sigantures and Certificates"</a> you can read more about them.
