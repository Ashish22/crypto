CreateCert_explain_text=With this form you can request a new certificate. You can keep the provided dummy data or fill out your own. In order for the certificate to be issued, you need to provide some proof of your identity. For this plug-in, we assume that a copy of a photo ID is sufficient. A sample photo ID will be provided if you chose none. You can chose an image from your local hard drive if you want to, though. The data you provide will not leave your computer though, all processes are fictional. You can find more about how PKIs check the identity of their users in the online help.\n\nYou can chose an existing public key by selecting "Chose public key." If you don't have a key pair yet, simply select "Generate new key pair before sending" and one will be created for you.\n\nOnce you're finished, you can forward your request to the fictional RA of this plug-in by clicking "Send CSR to RA." Afterwards, proceed to the "Registration Authority" tab to continue.
