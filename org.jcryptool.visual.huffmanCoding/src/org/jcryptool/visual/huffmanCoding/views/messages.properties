HuffmanCodingView_0=Parameter
HuffmanCodingView_1=This visualization presents the Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a method for lossless data compression. In this coding each character of the input text will be assigned to a different length of bit string depending on the frequency of occurrence of this character. Common characters are represented with a short and rarely occurring characters with a longer code word. In this way the redundant informations are summarized and the required storage space will be reduced. In this tab you can compress or uncompress a text. On the other tabs you can see the tree structure and the associated code table.
