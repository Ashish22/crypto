SigComposite_grpSignatureGeneration=Signature generation
SigComposite_grpSignedDoc=Signed document
SigComposite_title=SigVisualization
SigComposite_description=\r\nThis visualization demonstrates the creation of a digital signature for a specific document. A digital signature can be used to authenticate the identity of the sender of a message or of the signer of a document. It also ensures the integrity of the document.

SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep1=You can choose what to sign: either you open an existing document or you enter a text by yourself. To start the signature process, you have to click the button on the left and follow the instructions.
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep2=A hash function is an algorithm or subroutine that maps data sets of variable length to data sets of a fixed length (digest). Signing the message digest rather than the message improves the efficiency of the process because the message digest is usually much smaller in size than the message. The same hash algorithm used by the creator of the digital signature must be used by the verifier of a digital signature. 
SigComposite_txtDescriptionOfStep3=You can choose between different signature functions to sign the document. Some signature procedures are based on asymmetric encryption like RSA, other methods have been developed only for this purpose, for example DSA. To sign a document and verify the signature, you need two different keys. The private key is for generating the signature and has to be kept secret. The public key can be used by  someone else to verify your signature. Click on the icon below to create a new key pair or to use an existing key.
