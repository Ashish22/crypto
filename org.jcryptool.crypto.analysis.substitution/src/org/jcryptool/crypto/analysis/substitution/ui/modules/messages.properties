StatisticsSelector_0=<no predefined statistics available for the selected alphabet>
StatisticsSelector_1=Select precalculated statistics:
StatisticsSelector_2=Analyze custom reference text
StatisticsSelector_4=It is recommended to do this, because the ciphertext should consist of a set of characters very similar to that of the reference text, to 
StatisticsSelector_5=guarantee the usefulness of the generated statistic. For example, when analyzing a ciphertext that is only in uppercase letter, one should replace all lowercase charaters in the reference text with uppercase letters before analyzing it.
StatisticsSelector_6=%d: Language: %s | %s
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_0=Optionally, you can go to the second wizard page, to apply generic text transformations like Whitespace filtering, or upper-/lowercase transformation.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_10=Ciphertext
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_11=Please select a ciphertext:
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_12=Alphabet
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_13=The alphabet which contains the characters of the encrypted text is selected automatically.\r\nBecause the statistical data is calculated based on which characters appear in the alphabet, you may want to fine-adjust.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_14=Alphabet:
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_15=Statistical data
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_16=For the analysis, some reference statistics (frequency of single characters, 2- and 3-tuples) of a typical text are needed.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_18=Every language is different: You should select a reference, which matches the language of the ciphertext. If you don't find your language in the predefined statistics sets, please specify a custom reference text.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_19=Analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_20=The configurations are now complete; Start the analysis of the ciphertext by clicking on the button.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_22=To start a new analysis from there. just reset using the button on the view toolbar in the upper right corner.
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_23=Start the analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_8=Substitution analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisConfigPanel_9=For the analysis, you need to provide the following information:
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_0=Substitution analysis
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_1=Letter frequency statistics
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_10=Plaintext to cipher substitution:
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_12=<The substitutions must be completely filled out>
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_13=Load another reference statistic
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_2=Substitutions
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_3=Preview of the deciphered text
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_4=The substitution analysis consists of figuring out, which characters in the ciphertext have to be replaced by which former plaintext characters.\r\nThe reference- and ciphertext statistics help you with that. Single characters/pairs/triplets with similar frequencies very possible correspond to each other. Try to substitute these reference characters with their corresponding ciphertext characters with the substitution editor below, and observe how the plaintext changes.
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_5=Open the plaintext in a new editor
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_7=Below, the substitution will be displayed as String. In the first field, the substitution as set above will be shown; This is the substitution for ciphertext to plaintext conversion. A '?' marks all positions where a substitution was not yet set (fields outlined red above)\nThe other direction (plaintext to ciphertext) will be displayed in the second field, when possible (when every character in the editor above has got a substitution set).
SubstitutionAnalysisPanel_8=cipher to plaintext substitution:
TextLoadController_0=Load text...
TextLoadController_1=Loaded text:
TextLoadController_3=<A>choose another text...</A>
